[WH40k-Titans-informatron]
Intro=This mod provides Titans, large walking battle machines from the WarHammer 40,000 fictional universe, and special production and logistic options.\n\nPrimary idea of the mod is to depict huge and epic yet powerful technologies, which are hard to manage and transport.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Other important KPIs[/color][/font]\n\n- Make the mod and its content customisible – you can mount lots of various weapons to different Titans types.\n\n- AI and automation similar to RTS game genre.\n\n- Make the gameplay enthralling. Well, it's mostly a TODO as requires more work, creating corresponding threats and rewards.\n\n- Compatibility with most of overhaul mods, thanks to the Bridge Technologies, which is a mediator for large and smaller mods.\n\n- Atmospheric graphics, as pretty as I can achieve in reasonable amout of time, because I'm not a visual artist, just can do some 2D, 3D and audio stuff.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Disclaimer[/color][/font]\n\n- This mod may go against typical Factorio style, so, be ready to deal with it. I hope you'll like it, but if not, it's fine, mods are made to adjust gameplay experience to what fits you personally ;)\n\n- The mod is in beta-version with active development, hence, many things can be yet changed or rebalanced (although I strive to maintain backward compatibility), and many more content planned.\n\n- I'm not the best lore expert, just a fan, so, suggestions are welcome, but note that many decisions are made due to limitation of workforces (me alone) and technical possibilities of the game engine.
Lore1=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]In general[/color][/font]\n\nWH40k or [font=default-bold]WarHammer 40,000[/font] is a fictional universe detailing the far dark future. Its genre is also named techno-fantasy meaning that the universe contains magical things, but somehow explained by and co-exist with scifi technologies. The lore and stories are described by lots of books, tabletop and video games, short animated movies.\n\nIn more detail, WH40k tells stories of many different races and characters (focusing more on human beings) across Milky Way since about 60 million years before our time and 42 thousand years after our time. As for me, the most notable thing about WH40k is its atmosphere of dystopia and epicness, presenting suffers of billions of cityzens over millions so different planets and cultures, and fanatic duty, passionate striving for victory even in the face of evil gods or planet-scale weapons, just like madness and seduction by demons. Its popular symbol is the [font=default-bold]Space Marines[/font], genetically modified people living for hundreds of years mastering battle skills to protect and expand the [font=default-bold]Imperium of Mankind[/font].\n\nBut Warhammer's humanity has other interesting factions and departments, the most important now – [font=default-bold]Adeptus Mechanicus[/font], scientists and engineers (and cyborgs) named Tech Priests that believe in Machine Spirits, Omnissiah (the Machine God), and are fanatic about following rules of their religion. Oftenly, Mechanicus have entire planets dedicated for factories, called Forge Worlds. And their most glorious, majestic and powerful war machines are Titans which form divisions of [font=default-bold]Collegia Titanica[/font].
Lore2=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Titans[/color][/font]\n\nA Titan, sometimes colloquially called a God-Engine, is any one of several classes of massive, crewed, robotic combat walkers developed with partially forgotten patterns from the Dark Age of Technogolies – when the humankind achieved the best advanced in science beeing able to create and destroy stars, quantum robots with AGI and much more, but lost most of that knowledge. Some notable facts on Titans:\n\n- They contain anti-grav engines to support their weight and move faster, or vice versa, to hold steadier in space. Btw, in WH40k, anti-grav is used for many things like small robots named servo-skulls, hovering tanks, aircrafts and spaceships.\n\n- Titans have [font=default-bold]Void Shields[/font], which look similar to energy shields, but work totally differently: it's something like spherical portal to, ehm, the void, [font=default-bold]Immaterium, the Warp[/font]. Although Titans have really strong armor, most of attacks even don't touch them. But Void Shields consume lots of power to perform such transferring, hence can be overloaded with heavy fire.\n\n- Titans are managed by a crew with a governing driver named [font=default-bold]Princeps[/font], who is a noble person with body wired into Titans through [font=default-bold]Mind-Impulse Unit[/font] (kind of brain-computer interface technology).\n\n- Titans have advanced [font=default-bold]Machine Spirit[/font]. It can madden and take control over young and weak Princepses. Also it remembers all the previous Princepses and their experience, so that a new, strong one driver can use it, merging with the Spirit into a whole conscious.\n\n- Titans have large sizes, although description vary a lot in different sources. The smallest one, WarHound of Scout class, known to be 17 meters, but the largest one, Imperator, told to be from 45 to 140 meters. Personally, I tend to believe in the larger sizes, cuz, well, it's the epic WH40k!\n\nFrom my point of view, the ideas of Adeptus Mechanicus with their Forge Worlds fits Factorio style quite well, just like scifi cosmic style of WH40k and Space Exploration mod and Factorio 2 Space Age. And I just love Titans, thanks to the best, imho, RTS game Dawn of War and awesome mod Ultimate Apocalypse.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Types[/color][/font]\n\nThere are many patterns, classes and subclasses of Titans. For the purposes of this mod, I distinguished these 5 classes:\n\n1. [font=default-bold]War Hound[/font] pattern of Scout Titans class is the smallest class of Imperial Titan is used as a scout carrying out reconnaissance of the enemy lines or as the flanking element of a Titan Legion in conjunction with others of its kind.\n\n2. [font=default-bold]Reaver[/font] is flexible and multi-role, can partially act as heavily armed WarLord-class Titans, or as fast and agile Scout Titans, but the Reaver is a potent war machine in its own right.\n\n3. [font=default-bold]War Lord[/font] titan class forms the mainstay of Battle Titan Legions.\n\n4. [font=default-bold]War Master[/font] pattern of Heavy Battle Titan class is one most powerful machines in the Imperium of Man.\n\n5. [font=default-bold]Imperator[/font] pattern of Superheavy Battle Titan class, also known as Emperor Titan class or the God Engine, is the largest and most powerful military technology of humanity. Especially known for having buildings and church on its top, to protect from daemons and [font=default-bold]Chaos Gods[/font].\n\nIn the recipes, you will find a couple more special patterns of these classes.\n\nThe last but not the least note: Titan can use lots of different weapons mounted as arms or on their body, shoulders. And this mod allows you to configure own Titan pattern! Feel free choose a custom setup considering your ingredients and desires, just follow some simple rules which are described in the Assembly section.
Exploration=You can craft Titans, their details and ammo from scratch, by learning futuristic science and building extremely advanced factory: [technology=wh40k-titans-production] Titans Production. Let me know if you have overcome this challenge! Especially with overhaul mods ;)\n\nBut, as in real life, it's easier to find and explore exsiting technologies, and this process in called reverse-engineering. So, you can find and reconstruct fallen Titans! There are several steps to do this:
Exploration-Extract=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Step 1. Extract details[/color][/font]\n\nSearch for titan ruins, build an excavation machine [item=wh40k-titans-extractor] and use it to retrieve titan details and ammo.
Exploration-RevLab=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Step 2. Use RevLab[/color][/font]\n\nUse a dedicated reverse engineering lab [item=af-reverse-lab-2] to retrieve science packs of Titans technology.\n\nTend to wisely decide which details you plan to spend on reverse-engineering or to leave for further usage. You can also use reverse-engineering worth evaluator to consider possible output of each item you get:
Exploration-Research=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Step 3. Research[/color][/font]\n\nPut the science packs into special WH40k lab [item=wh40k-lab] and conduct the following tech researches:\n\n1. [technology=wh40k-titans-assembly] Titans Assembly – allows to craft Titans Assembly Bunker.\n\n2. [technology=wh40k-titans-1-class] Titan class 1 War Hound – allows to assemble the smallest titan class.\n\n3. [technology=wh40k-titans-0-grade] Titan weapons grade 0 Minimalis – allows to assemble basic Titans' weaponary.
Titan-usage=Basically, it's like a car: use Enter and WASD / arrows.\n\nPress attack shortcusts [__CONTROL__wh40k-titans-attack-1__], [__CONTROL__wh40k-titans-attack-2__], [__CONTROL__wh40k-titans-attack-3__] to use the weapons.
Titan-usage-db=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Titan Dashboard[/color][/font]\n\nWhen you get into a Titan, a special dashboard opens. It allows:\n\n- See amout of health, void shield, weapons ammo. You can toggle between percent and absolute values view by clicking on any cell.\n\n- Zoom out by clicking on the [item=radar] radar icon.\n\n- Change weapons modes and bindings:\n\n    * Digits [virtual-signal=signal-1] [virtual-signal=signal-2] [virtual-signal=signal-3] mean that a gun linked to corresponding attack shortcut. Feel free to assign several weapons to the same key: on click, any free one will be used.\n\n    * [virtual-signal=signal-info] means that Titan will use the weapon automatically by simple AI.\n\n    * [virtual-signal=signal-red] means that the weapon usage is disabled.\n\nSo, you can drive a Titan going through enemies transferring weapons control to the AI, maybe leaving only the most powerful gun for personal use.
