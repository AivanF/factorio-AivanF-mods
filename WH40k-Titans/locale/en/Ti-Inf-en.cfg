[WH40k-Titans-informatron]
BunkerOLD=Titans are HUGE, hence, it’s not possible to mine/loot a Titan into a small item and manually place elsewhere. Instead, a special entity is used to combine details, set up configurations, and assemble or deconstruct these mighty war machines: [font=default-bold]the Titan Assembly Bunker[/font].\n\nThe Assembly Bunker itself is a complex building consisting of multiple parts, some of which supposed to be hidden under the ground. The most notable parts are the following: center object to open operational window and storages for details of weapons and body. To function, a Bunker shall be activated after placement.\n\nThe Bunker has many lamps to highlight statuses of its components. Their behavior vary for different modes, but corner lamps represent Bunker’s mode.\n\nAn active Bunker has several operation modes that you can switch:\n\n    [virtual-signal=signal-green] Assembling and assembly preparing\n    [virtual-signal=signal-pink] Disassembling and waiting for a Titan to disassemble\n    [virtual-signal=signal-yellow] Restocking Titans’ and Suppliers’ ammunition\n    [virtual-signal=signal-cyan] Clearing Titans and Supplier’ ammo back into Bunker\n\nHopefully, most of the modes are easily understandable, so let’s learn about the most important one.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Assembling[/color][/font]\n\nTo assemble a Titan, you need to select its class and choose weapons for each mounting point of the class following special rules, and put required details. Mention the different storages: details for Titans body, details and ammo for weapons are taken from  the corresponding storages only. In case you are ok with logic system, there are combinators nearby each storage, which output numbers of required items – \n\nIf you made anything wrong, it’s not a big problem: the status line in the Bunker’s dashboard window will tell what’s going on. Also, the lamps will highlight what parts relate to the issue. Here is a list of most often colors reasons:\n\n    [virtual-signal=signal-red] Missing or excessive weapon\n    [virtual-signal=signal-yellow] Not enough details\n    [virtual-signal=signal-green] Segment is ready for assembling\n\nRemember that you can always disassemble a Titan and construct it again in case you’d like to change its weapons.\n\nNote that disassembling a damaged Titan leads to wasting frame and motor details, proportionally to the lost health amount.\n\n[font=default-bold]Warning[/font]: Titans are huge and easily can accidentally destroy nearby buildings by mere walking. The Bunker itself is immune to such damage, but consider placing them outside of you factory center, to provide sufficient space for Titans.
Intro=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]TLDR intro[/color][/font]\n\nThis mod provides Titans, large and extremely strong walking battle vehicles from a fictional universe named WarHammer 40,000, together with special production and logistic problems and possibilities.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Cool introduction[/color][/font]\n\nTechPriest, are you seeking Omnissiah blessing to protect and expand your Forge World?.. Legio Titanicus is here for you! The mod provides [font=default-bold]unique and customizable war machines[/font] from WarHammer 40.000 with enormously powerful military capabilities. Production challenges included! Or have a rest from factories – [font=default-bold]explore and restore broken Titans[/font], performing real Adeptus Mechanicus expeditions!\n\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Goals[/color][/font]\n\nPrimary idea of the mod is to depict huge and complicated technologies, which are hard for production and logistics, but it reward you with powerful battle options and epic feelings.\n\nOther important KPIs:\n\n    – Make the mod and its content customisible – you can mount lots of various weapons to different Titans types, as well as find many settings to adjust mod for your personal preferences.\n\n    – AI and automation similar to RTS game genre.\n\n    – Make the gameplay enthralling. Well, it’s mostly a TODO as requires more work, creating corresponding threats and rewards.\n\n    – Adhere to Factorio’s mechanics and content whenever possible and reasonable.\n\n    – Compatibility with most of overhaul mods, thanks to the Bridge Technologies, which is a mediator between large and smaller mods.\n\n    – Atmospheric graphics, as pretty as I can achieve in reasonable amout of time, because I’m not a visual artist, just can do some 2D, 3D and audio stuff.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Disclaimer[/color][/font]\n\n    – This mod may go against typical Factorio style, so, be ready to deal with it. I hope you’ll like playing this way, but if not, it’s fine, mods are made to adjust game experience to what fits you personally ;)\n\n    – I’m not the best lore expert, just an advanced fan, and never played WH40k tabletop. I try to follow the lore as much as I can research and as much as it allows to make the gameplay balanced on simplicity and complexity. Also, many decisions are made due to limitation of workforces (me alone) and technical possibilities of the game engine. But in general, suggestions and advices are welcome! Especially ones that introduce new fascinating content or mechanics.\n\n    – [font=default-bold]WIP WARNING[/font]: the mod is in beta-version with active development. I strive to maintain backward compatibility, so the mod should be safe for your save files (anyway, periodic saves are good), but many things can be yet changed and rebalanced, so, you with caution (logistic robots are suggested, to easily adjust transportation when needed). And many more epic content will be added!
Lore1=It’s not required to know much lore to enjoy the mod, but in case you’d like to learn more, here is my manuscript.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]In general[/color][/font]\n\nWH40k or [font=default-bold]WarHammer 40,000[/font] is a fictional universe detailing the far dark future. Its genre is also named techno-fantasy meaning that the universe contains magical things, but somehow explained by and co-exist with scifi technologies. The lore and stories are described by lots of books, tabletop and video games, short animated movies.\n\nIn more detail, WH40k tells stories of many different alien races (called xenos) and characters (focusing more on human beings) across Milky Way since about 60 million years before our time and 42 thousand years after our time. As for me, the most notable thing about WH40k is its atmosphere of dystopia and epicness, presenting suffers of billions of cityzens over millions so different planets and cultures, and fanatic duty, passionate striving for victory even in the face of evil gods or planet-scale weapons, just like madness and seduction by demons. Its popular symbol is the [font=default-bold]Space Marines[/font], genetically modified people living for hundreds of years mastering battle skills to protect and expand the [font=default-bold]Imperium of Mankind[/font].\n\nBut Warhammer’s humanity has other interesting factions and departments, the most important now – [font=default-bold]Adeptus Mechanicus[/font] – scientists and engineers (and cyborgs) named [font=default-bold]Tech Priests[/font] that believe in Machine Spirits, Omnissiah (the Machine God), and are fanatic about following rules of their technological religion. Oftenly, Mechanicus have entire planets dedicated for factories, called Forge Worlds. And their most glorious, majestic and powerful war machines are Titans which form divisions of [font=default-bold]Collegia Titanica[/font].
Lore2=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Titans[/color][/font]\n\nA Titan, sometimes colloquially called a God-Engine, is any one of several classes of massive, crewed, robotic combat walkers developed with partially forgotten patterns from the Dark Age of Technogolies – when the humankind achieved the best advanced in science beeing able to create and destroy stars, quantum robots with AGI (artigicial general intelligence) and much more, but lost most of that knowledge. Some notable facts on Titans:\n\n    – They contain anti-grav engines to support their weight and move faster, or vice versa, to hold steadier in space. Btw, in WH40k, anti-grav is used for many things like small robots named servo-skulls, hovering tanks, aircrafts and spaceships.\n\n    – Titans have [font=default-bold]Void Shields[/font], which look similar to energy shields, but work totally differently: it’s something like spherical portal to, ehm, the void, [font=default-bold]Immaterium, the Warp[/font]. Although Titans have really strong armor, most of attacks even don’t touch them. But Void Shields consume lots of power to perform such transferring, hence can be overloaded with heavy fire. Also, they absorb only high-velocity projectiles and pass relatively slow attacks.\n\n    – Titans are managed by a crew with a governing driver named [font=default-bold]Princeps[/font], who is a noble person with body wired into Titans through [font=default-bold]Mind-Impulse Unit[/font] (kind of brain-computer interface technology).\n\n    – Titans have advanced [font=default-bold]Machine Spirit[/font]. It can madden and take control over young and weak Princepses. Also it remembers all the previous Princepses and their experience, so that a new, strong one driver can use it, merging with the Spirit into a whole conscious.\n\n    – Titans have large sizes, although description vary a lot in different sources. The smallest one, WarHound of Scout class, known to be 17 meters, but the largest one, Imperator, told to be from 45 to 140 meters. Personally, I tend to believe in the larger sizes, because, well, it’s the epic WH40k! Therefore, here you won’t see that the same plasma weapons can be mounted on WarLord and Imperator classes.\n\nFrom my point of view, the ideas of Adeptus Mechanicus with their Forge Worlds fits Factorio style quite well, just like scifi cosmic style of WH40k and Space Exploration mod and Factorio 2 Space Age. And I just love Titans, thanks to the best, imho, RTS game Dawn of War and awesome mod Ultimate Apocalypse.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Types[/color][/font]\n\nThere are many patterns, classes and subclasses of Titans. For the purposes of this mod, I distinguished 5 classes and some subypes:\n\n    1. [font=default-bold]Scount Titans[/font] class consisting of [font=default-bold]War Hound[/font] and less known [font=default-bold]Dire Wolf[/font] types. This is the smallest class of Imperial Titans and used as a scout carrying out reconnaissance of the enemy lines or as the flanking element of a Titan Legion in conjunction with others of its kind.\n\n    2. [font=default-bold]Reaver[/font] of [font=default-bold]Lite Battle Titan[/font] class – flexible and multi-role, can partially act as heavily armed WarLord-class Titans, or as fast and agile Scout Titans, but the Reaver is a potent war machine in its own right.\n\n    3. [font=default-bold]Battle Titans[/font] class forms the mainstay of Titan Legions. Notable types: multi-role [font=default-bold]War Lord[/font] and high-range [font=default-bold]War Bringer[/font].\n\n    4. [font=default-bold]War Master[/font] type of [font=default-bold]Heavy Battle Titan[/font] class is one most powerful machines in the Imperium of Man.\n\n    5. [font=default-bold]Superheavy Battle Titan[/font] class, also known as [font=default-bold]Emperor Titan[/font] class or the God Engine, consisting of [font=default-bold]Imperator[/font] and [font=default-bold]War Monger[/font] types, is the largest and most powerful military technology of humanity. Especially known for having buildings and church on its top, to protect from daemons and [font=default-bold]Chaos Gods[/font].\n\nThe last but not the least note: Titan can use lots of different weapons mounted as arms or on their body’s carapace, shoulders. And this mod allows you [font=default-bold]to configure own Titan pattern![/font] Feel free choose a custom setup considering your ingredients and desires, just follow some simple rules which are described in the Assembly section.\n\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Weapon categories[/color][/font]\n\nWarHammer is full of various weaponry, both of the human race and xenos. Here I’ll introduce some of the most important ones for this mod:\n\n    [recipe=wh40k-titans-vulcan-mega-bolter] [item=wh40k-titans-bolt-big] [font=default-bold]Bolter weapons[/font] – bolts are similar to firearm cartridges, but have more complicated design and they essentially are miniature rockets. Bolter guns are also the most notable weapon type of the WH40k! Having lots of calibres and types, the largest bolts are utilised by Titans too.\n\n    [recipe=wh40k-titans-gatling-blaster] [item=explosive-cannon-shell] [font=default-bold]Auto weapons[/font] – considered ideally suited for attacking enemy vehicles and fortifications from long range. Playing a similar role to laser cannons, they can fire more rapidly and are less prone to overheating. However, the need to carry large amounts of ammunition is a distinct disadvantage.\n\n    [recipe=wh40k-titans-apocalypse-missiles] [item=explosive-rocket] [font=default-bold]Missile launchers[/font] – artillery that fires guided and unguided projectiles and can hit a target from a substantial distance away.\n\n    [item=wh40k-titans-doom-missile] [font=default-bold]Deathstrike missile launchers[/font] – heavy artillery with mighty rockets that can reach other continents and even orbit causing colossal destruction. The missiles have several subtypes to deal damage from a nuclear bomb to insanely ruinous Warp annihilation.\n\n    [recipe=wh40k-titans-turbo-laser-destructor] [item=wh40k-titans-laser-ammo] [font=default-bold]Laser weapons[/font] – a family of directed energy weapons that produce beams of high-intensity, amplified light that induce heat damage when they strike a target. Laser weapons are relatively easy to produce and maintain.\n\n    [recipe=wh40k-titans-plasma-blastgun] [item=afci-plasma-fuel] [font=default-bold]Plasma weapons[/font] – they work by delivering pulses of searing energy and superheated matter that have been transmuted into a gaseous plasma state that carries an electrical charge. The plasma "bolts" fired by these weapons explode on impact and generate the destructive heat of a small sun.\n\n    [recipe=wh40k-titans-volkite-destructor] [item=wh40k-titans-melta-ammo] [font=default-bold]Melta weapons[/font] – a type of short-range, thermal energy weapons that make use of a sub-atomic reaction in a special fuel source to produce a tightly-focused beam of intense, searing heat. Meltas are the premier anti-armour weapons, focusing onto large protected targets such as vehicles or monstrous creatures. There is a different application of the same technological principles – Melta Bombs, its reactive fusion fuel has already been hyper-condensed and is no less devastating, designed to consume itself in a single burst of energy.\n\n    [recipe=wh40k-titans-volcano-cannon] [item=wh40k-titans-hellstorm-ammo] [font=default-bold]Hellstorm weapons[/font] – incredibly powerful cannons that deal enormous damage forcing atoms to explode and converting even void itself into quark-plasma.\n\n    [recipe=wh40k-titans-chainsword] [font=default-bold]Melee weapons[/font] – oversized and extremely deadly close quarters combat weapons. Why bother with close combat, you may ask?.. Well, they freely go through the void shields! There are particular subtypes of melee weapons:\n        * [color=#ffe6c0]Chain weapons[/color] – they utilize a cutting chain mechanism (similar in principle to a chainsaw) along the length of the striking edge to produce high physical damage.\n        * [color=#ffe6c0]Power weapons[/color] – their blades become sheathed in a field of energy which disrupts solid matter, allowing the weapon to easily tear through tough armour.
Exploration=You can craft Titans, their details and ammo from scratch, by learning futuristic science and building extremely advanced factory: [font=default-bold][technology=wh40k-titans-production] Titans Production[/font]. Let me know if you have overcome this challenge! Especially with overhaul mods ;)\n\nBut, as in the real life, it’s easier to find and explore exsiting technologies. This process in called [font=default-bold]reverse-engineering[/font]. Here, you can find and reconstruct fallen Titans! There are several steps to do this:
Exploration-Extract=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Step 1. Extract details[/color][/font]\n\nYou can find traces of mighty ancient battles: ruins of fallen Titans. Similar wrecks appear when your own Titans get destroyed. Search for such fallen Titans, build an [font=default-bold]excavation machine [item=wh40k-titans-extractor][/font] and use it to retrieve titan details and ammo.\n\nWrecks of fallen Titans keep their details and ammo, but the process of extraction cannot retrieve all everything intact: basic output probability is 40% and you can increase it up to 99% with the [font=default-bold][technology=wh40k-titans-excavation-efficiency-1] Titans Excavation Efficiency research[/font] [color=0.5,0.7,0.8](at least partial improvement of this technology should probably be your first aim)[/color]. You can also dramatically speed up this process with [font=default-bold][technology=wh40k-titans-excavation-speed-1] Titans Excavation Speed research[/font].
Exploration-RevLab=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Step 2. Use RevLab[/color][/font]\n\nUse a dedicated [font=default-bold]reverse engineering lab [item=af-reverse-lab-2][/font] to retrieve science packs of Titans technology.\n\nTend to wisely decide which details you plan to spend on reverse-engineering or to leave for further usage. Click here to read more about Reverse Lab and items worth evaluating to consider possible output of each item you have:
Exploration-Research=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Step 3. Research[/color][/font]\n\nPut the science packs into special [font=default-bold]WH40k lab [item=wh40k-lab][/font] and conduct the following tech researches:\n\n    1. [font=default-bold][technology=wh40k-titans-assembly] Titans Assembly[/font] – allows to craft Titans Assembly Bunker.\n\n    2. [font=default-bold][technology=wh40k-titans-1-class] Titan class Scout[/font] – allows to assemble the smallest titan class.\n\n    3. [font=default-bold][technology=wh40k-titans-0-grade] Titan weapons grade Minimalis[/font] – allows to assemble basic Titans’ weaponary.
Bunker1=Titans are HUGE, hence, it’s not possible to mine/loot a Titan into a small item and manually place elsewhere. Instead, a special entity is used to combine details, set up configurations, and assemble or deconstruct these mighty war machines: [font=default-bold]the Titan Assembly Bunker[/font].\n\nThe Assembly Bunker itself is a complex building consisting of multiple parts, some of which supposed to be hidden under the ground. The most notable parts are the following: center object to open operational window and storages for details of weapons and body. To function, a Bunker shall be activated after placement.\n\nThe Bunker has many lamps to highlight statuses of its components. Their behavior vary for different modes, but corner lamps represent Bunker’s mode.\n\nAn active Bunker has several operation modes that you can switch:\n\n    [virtual-signal=signal-green] Assembling and assembly preparing\n    [virtual-signal=signal-pink] Disassembling and waiting for a Titan to disassemble\n    [virtual-signal=signal-yellow] Restocking Titans’ and Suppliers’ ammunition\n    [virtual-signal=signal-cyan] Clearing Titans and Supplier’ ammo back into Bunker\n\nHopefully, the modes are easily understandable, so let’s learn about the most important one.
Bunker2=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Assembling[/color][/font]\n\nTo assemble a Titan, enable assembling mode, then you need to select its class and choose weapons for each mounting point of the class following special rules, and put required details. Mention the different storages: details for Titans body, details and ammo for weapons are taken from  the corresponding storages only. In case you are ok with logic system, there are combinators nearby each storage, which output numbers of required items.\n\nIf you made anything wrong, it’s not a big problem: the status line in the Bunker’s dashboard window will tell what’s going on. Also, the lamps will highlight what parts relate to the issue. Here is a list of most often colors reasons:\n\n    [virtual-signal=signal-red] Missing or excessive weapon\n    [virtual-signal=signal-yellow] Not enough details\n    [virtual-signal=signal-green] Segment is ready for assembling\n\nRemember that you can always disassemble a Titan and construct it again in case you’d like to change its weapons.\n\nNote that disassembling a damaged Titan leads to wasting frame and motor details, proportionally to the lost health amount.\n\n[font=default-bold]Warning[/font]: Titans are huge and easily can accidentally destroy nearby buildings by mere walking. The Bunker itself is immune to such damage, but consider placing them outside of you factory center, to provide sufficient space for Titans.
Weapons-Rules=[font=default-bold]Disclaimer:[/font] the system described here is fully designed by myself (including division weapons into grades and mounting points types), I try to stick to the lore as much as possible, but not absolutely, firstly striving to provide great gameplay experience. So, don’t treat the mod as lore-true.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Weapon types[/color][/font]\n\nEvery titanic weapon has several properties: attack range, cool down time, damage specification, grade and mounting type.\n\nThere are 3 main weapons’ mounting types:\n\n    [virtual-signal=signal-M] – [font=default-bold]melee[/font] weapon.\n    [virtual-signal=signal-B] – [font=default-bold]basic[/font], general type of most cannons.\n    [virtual-signal=signal-A] – [font=default-bold]artillery[/font], can only be placed on top.\n\nGrades relate to weapons’ sizes and energy consumption. In total, there are 6 grades and their technological researches:\n\n    [technology=wh40k-titans-0-grade] Grade 0. [font=default-bold]Minimalis[/font]\n    [technology=wh40k-titans-1-grade] Grade 1. [font=default-bold]Validus[/font]\n    [technology=wh40k-titans-2-grade] Grade 2. [font=default-bold]Solidus[/font]\n    [technology=wh40k-titans-3-grade] Grade 3. [font=default-bold]Fortis[/font]\n    [technology=wh40k-titans-4-grade] Grade 4. [font=default-bold]Magnus[/font]\n    [technology=wh40k-titans-5-grade] Grade 5. [font=default-bold]Grandis[/font]\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Mounting point types[/color][/font]\n\nFrom other side, each Titan has weaponry pattern that determines a set of weapon mounting points. Each mounting point has their properties: type and grade.\n\nSpeaking of grades, mounting points allow to place weapons of grade the same as of the mounting point or 1 grade lower. So, you can put weaker (and cheaper) weapons on a Titan than it was designed for, but you cannot place small gun on a large Titan or too strong cannon on a weak Titan.\n\nHere is a list of mounting position types:\n\n    [virtual-signal=signal-H] – [font=default-bold]hand / arm[/font], allows most of weapon types including melee.\n    [virtual-signal=signal-C] – [font=default-bold]carapace[/font], allows most of weapons, excepting melee and artillery that shoot upwards.\n    [virtual-signal=signal-T] – [font=default-bold]top[/font], allows almost all of the ranged weapons.\n    [virtual-signal=signal-A] – [font=default-bold]artillery[/font], only allows cannons that attack upwards.\n\nBasically, most of the guns can be freely put on top or down positions, excepting artillery cannons that require mounting on top, while melee weapons require lower mounting. Top positions are especially important because [font=default-bold]they provide +10% to max attack range[/font] for mounted weapons (the range also get increased with titan class and researches).\n\nTitans weaponry patterns can be written, e.g:\n\n    1. War Hound’s pattern [color=#ffe6c0]"H1 H1"[/color] means that a Titan has a couple of down mounting points (arms in this case) for weapons of grades Validus or Minimalis.\n    2. The pattern of Dire Wolf [color=#ffe6c0]"H0 H0 T2"[/color] represents two not top mounting points of grade Minimalis and one top point for a weapon of grade Solidus or Validus.\n    3. And the War Bringer’s pattern [color=#ffe6c0]"H2 H2 A4"[/color] says that two not top weapons of grade Solidus or Validus are allowed and one artillery (top-only) weapon of grade Magnus or Fortis.
Titan-usage=Basically, Titans are controlled like a car: use Enter and WASD / arrows.\n\nPress attack shortcuts [__CONTROL__wh40k-titans-attack-1__], [__CONTROL__wh40k-titans-attack-2__], [__CONTROL__wh40k-titans-attack-3__], [__CONTROL__wh40k-titans-attack-4__] to use the weapons. These hotkeys may overlap with builtin shortcuts or from other mods, so, don’t get surprised with some messages (especially for the [color=#ffe6c0]X[/color] key). And keep in mind, that they work even in the map-view, which is especially useful for high-ranged attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Titans deal stomping damage, so, even their walking is a weapon itself.\n\nTitans require no fuel to operate, as they have built-in sci-fi energy source.\n\nAlso they have additional smaller automatic laser cannons mounted on the carapace. Bigger Titans have more of such turrets.\n\nAs they are large and very special vehicles, and you can’t put ammo into Titans by hands, only Assembly Bunker and Titanic Suppliers can restock their dedicated ammo inventories.
Titan-usage-db=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Titan Dashboard[/color][/font]\n\nWhen you get into a Titan, a special dashboard opens. I made tooltips for all the icons and buttons, hover them and explore more helpful info! In general, the dashboard allows:\n\n    – See amout of health, void shield, weapons ammo. You can toggle between percent and absolute values view by clicking on any cell.\n\n    – Zoom out by clicking on the [item=radar] radar icon.\n\n    – Change weapons modes and bindings:\n\n        * Digits [virtual-signal=signal-1] [virtual-signal=signal-2] [virtual-signal=signal-3] [virtual-signal=signal-4] mean that a gun linked to corresponding attack shortcut. Feel free to assign several weapons to the same key: on click, any free one will be used.\n        * [virtual-signal=signal-info] means that Titan will use the weapon automatically by simple AI.\n        * [virtual-signal=signal-red] means that the weapon usage is disabled.\n\nSo, you can drive a Titan going through enemies transferring weapons control to the AI, maybe leaving only the most powerful gun for personal use.\n\nThe hoteky bindings are not per-machine, but per-user, so, in a multi-player game, multiple players can drive a Titan controlling the same or separate weapons!
Supplier-usage=Titanic Supplier is an aircraft vehicle made with technologies similar to used in Titans and designed to restock their ammo right on the battlefield. But there is a price for such convenience: low ammo transfer rate (and fuel which these aircrafts consume a lot).\n\nSupplier’s operation is quite straightforward:\n\n    1. Craft the aircraft similar to other Factorio vehicles.\n    2. Direct it to a Titans Assembly Bunker that have ammo in it.\n    3. After the Supplier received some ammunition, you can guide it to a Titan needing the ammo.\n    4. And when they’ll become close enough to each other, the Supplier will do its job.\n\nBut there are some other things to note:\n\n- Suppliers, similarly to Titans, have separate inventory to store ammo, and you can’t interact with it directly, only through the Assembly Bunker.\n\n- This inventory is limited, the limitation is not by stacks, but by total weight. Each ammo item has a mass value (see the table below for exact numbers), and by default a Supplier can hold up to 10k mass pcs.\n\n- The ammo’s weight also affects its transferring speed.\n\n- Each Supplier has filters that allow you to disable collecting of specific ammunition types from the Bunkers.\n\nHere are weights of all possible titanic ammunition:
Misc=[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]General dashboard[/color][/font]\n\nBesides windows opened when you enter a Titan or a Supplier, there is the [font=default-bold]General Dashboard[/font] that lists all of your vehicles, their stats, and allows to find them on the map.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Wrecks on other planets[/color][/font]\n\nBy default, Titans ruins spawn on Nauvis only, and are missing on surfaces introduced by other mods. An integration with Warptorio, Space Exploration and Factorio 2 Space Age is being developed.\n\nFor now, you can use the following cheaty yet helpful console command that spawns fallen Titans on any surface the player is currently on:\n    [color=#ffe6c0]/titans-spawn-more-corpses[/color]\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]God mode[/color][/font]\n\nGod mode provides several additional opportunities:\n\n    – Assembly Bunkers allow to pick any Titan body or weapon type independently of explored researches.\n    – You can get and place Titans as items, like cars, and they will receive a default weapons pattern with fully filled ammo! Although Titans are still not minable back into items.\n\nThe god modes are available by console commands, sandbox scenario, or special mods like Editor Extensions, Blueprint Lab, etc.\n\nAlso, if you’d like to perform a quick test of the WH40k Titans mod, you can enable the [font=default-bold]special debugging flag[/font] that dramatically speeds up all the slow processes, see runtime/map settings.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]3D graphics[/color][/font]\n\nSometimes I get questions like why Titans look so plain, why some 3D models aren’t used?\n\nA detailed answer can be found on the Discussions mod page on Factorio mods website. Here I’ll explain the issue briefly.\n\n[font=default-bold]Factorio is a 2D game[/font] that just looks like 3D by having lots of pictures, sprites of 3D modeles rendered from different sides.\n\nSimilar approach is used for this mod, but there is a big problem: it’s really hard to make large composite structures look like actual 3D, this requires lots of renders for every model of Titans, some their parts, and weapons, as well as lots of coding to combine such moving and overlapping parts into mathematically correct whole objects. This is a huge amount of work, yet possible, but will also lead to large CPU and video memory usage, and hence, bad performance. Maybe one day I’ll try to experiment with it, but don’t expect it any soon.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Expected features[/color][/font]\n\n    – More different weapons, at least planned ones.\n    – More different Titans: Ordo Sinister, Corrupted, Orks Gargants, Tau Mantas, Necron Monoliths, etc.\n    – Strong enemies from other fictional universes that I like\n    – Support of mods with other planets, espcially Factorio 2 Space Age\n    – Cosmic transportation: cross-planets and fast-travel over single surface\n    – Other epic WH40k mods, not just skins nor yet-another small guns and vehicles
AI=At the moment, Titans can have 2 separate subsystems for automatic control:\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Automatic weapons control[/color][/font]\n\nAs was described on the Titans Usage page, there is AI mode for weapons. It’s managed solely by the code of this mod.\n\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Automatic driving[/color][/font]\n\nIf the [font=default-bold]AAI Programmable Vehicles[/font] mod is enabled, you can control Titans just like other vehicles with a remote tool. The integration seem to be not perfect, but still fully playable. And you’ll probably enable automatic weapons control before sending Titans remotely.\n\nThe Titanic Supplier aircraft also supports remote control: you can guide it to the Titans Assembly Bunker to collect the ammo, and to follow a Titan to supply it, or just as a personal super-fast taxi.
ToDo=This manuscript is not finished yet, but I’m working on it!
