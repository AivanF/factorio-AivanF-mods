wh40k-titanic-frame-part=Hard composite material that consists most volume of Imperium spaceships and Titans.

wh40k-titanic-motor=Holds and moves titan body, legs, arms, cannons.
# Common
wh40k-anti-grav-engine=Allows to overpass the gravity force. This technology is used to reduce weight of Titans, providing capacity to carry huge loads of ammunition, as well as the weight of big spaceships allowing them to land on planets.

# Weapons parts
wh40k-titanic-projectile-engine=Quickly moves mechanical projectiles. Used for titanic bolters, auto cannons, missile launchers.
wh40k-titanic-melta-pump=Quickly moves huge amounts of fluid ammunition. Used for titanic flame-throwers, melta, plasma weapons.

# g1
wh40k-titans-inferno=Burns and slows down disgusting xenos.
wh40k-titans-vulcan-mega-bolter=The roar of the Vulcan while firing has earned it the nickname "laughter of the devil". If the Vulcan has one deficiency it is that it’s highly inaccurate, although precision is not needed for a weapon which can fill several hundred square meters with exploding death.

# Ammo
wh40k-titans-bolt-big=Deals 750 damage, considered to be kind of safe for other Titans in case of friendly fire.
wh40k-titans-bolt-huge=Deals 2500 damage, deadly for anything.
