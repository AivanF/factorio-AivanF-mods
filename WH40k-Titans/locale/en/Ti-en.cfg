# Body parts
wh40k-servitor=A dumb yet storng cyborg knowing no paing or fatigue (tbh, programmed to ignore it). They are used as soldiers (cannon fodder) or hard-working builders and repairer (inside Titans also).
wh40k-energy-core=Provides enormous amount of energy required to feed Void Shields and Titans weaponary.
wh40k-titanic-frame-part=Hard composite material that consists most volume of Imperium spaceships and Titans.
wh40k-void-shield-gen=Creates thin yet powerful shield that annihilates incoming damage by transferring it into Immaterium. It consumes high amount of energy, hence, this technology is used by Titans and spaceships.
wh40k-titanic-motor=Carries titan body, legs, arms, cannons.
# Common
wh40k-anti-grav-engine=Allows to overpass the gravity force. This technology is used to reduce weight of Titans, providing capacity to carry huge loads of ammunition, as well as the weight of big spaceships allowing them to land on planets. Can be also used for powerful weapons like Graviton Ruinator.
wh40k-reality-controller=Allows to break the border between reality and Immaterium. This advanced mechanism is used for technologies like teleportaion and void shields.
# Weapons parts
wh40k-titanic-projectile-engine=Quickly moves mechanical projectiles. Used for titanic bolters, auto cannons, missile launchers.
wh40k-titanic-melta-pump=Quickly moves huge amounts of fluid ammunition. Used for titanic flame-throwers, melta, plasma weapons.

wh40k-lab=A small part of Standard Template Construct system from the Dark Age of Technologies.
wh40k-titan-warhound=Titan class 1. War Hound is the smallest class of Imperial Titan is used as a scout carrying out reconnaissance of the enemy lines or as the flanking element of a Titan Legion in conjunction with others of its kind.
wh40k-titan-direwolf=Titan class 1. Dire Wolf is a Heavy Scout Titan, a sturdier yet slower version of War Hound, carrying a top cannon similar to Reaver.
wh40k-titan-reaver=Titan class 2. Reaver is flexible and multi-role, not as heavily armed as the Warlord-class Titans, or as fast and agile as the Scout Titans, but the Reaver is a potent war machine in its own right.
wh40k-titan-warlord=Titan class 3. War Lord titan, carrying 2 heavy arm cannons and 2 shoulder guns, forms the mainstay of Battle Titan Legions.
wh40k-titan-warmaster=Titan class 4. War Master is a Heavy Battle Titan and one most powerful machines in the Imperium of Man.
