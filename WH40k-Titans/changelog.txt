Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2024-11-23
  Features:
    - Titan Assembly Bunker now allows to choose only appropriate weapons, suitable for specific mounting position, so that you don't need to remember rules details.
    - Titan Assembly Bunker now shows all the issues together (in a pop-up tooltip), so that you have the full, comprehensive understanding and can solve the problems in any order.

  Changes:
    - Titan Ruin Extractor now can be placed and removed by robots.
    - Earlier Aircraft Supplier technology.
    - Increased Titan ruins Extractor search area (actually, the opposite: inceased invisible size of Titan wrecks).
    - Removed "WH40k_Titans.reload ..." text upon mods configuration changes if no issues noticed.
    - Added pretty intro text on configuration update.

  Graphics:
    - Titans don't look as cars when placed or opened!
    - Fixed bad Lab picture (looked as a corner since Factorio 2).
    - Removed low-res pictures, because high-res is the only option in Factorio 2. Hopefully, no other visual issues should be met, but you know, it's hard to fully test such large mod alone.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Inferno flamethrower shooting from Titan center instead of cannon muzzle, which appeared in Factorio 2 because the devs made stream projectiles start from source entity ignoring start position.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2024-11-21

    - Void shields now pass 80% of melee damage! Also adjustable with startup settings.
  Bugfixes:
    - In previous release, I forgot to disable debug mode in the code, which adds technical info and makes some processes really fast. To prevent such cases, now debug flags are set by runtime/map settings. In addition, this allows players to help debuging the mod!
    - Silenced a reported error of Reverse-Engineering integration, as I couldn't reproduce it to solve properly, I guess it's due to some special mods, but now it can be explored with more details using mentioned settings.
    - Assembly Bunker wasn't showing last 2 weapons grades, even if they are researched. Sad that nobody noticed and reported it!
  Info:
    - Better info for weapons that don't use ammo (like ChainSword) in the Titan Dashboard.
    - More tooltips in all the dashboards.
    - Informatron: I shared more knowledge about weapons in the "Lore" section and about God-mode possibilities in the "Misc" section.

    - Added actual Titans' assembly time into recipe description.
  Balancing:

    - Enabled productivity modules for many recipes.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Supplier aircraft mining error.
  Changes:
    - Void Shields cannot be put into equipment grid (which was added in previous version as an experiment).
