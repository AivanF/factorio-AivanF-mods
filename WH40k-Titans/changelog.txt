Version: 0.9.24
Date: 2024-08-27
  Balancing:
    - Higher range for most of Titans weapons.
    - Enabled productivity modules for many recipes.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Supplier aircraft mining error.
  Changes:
    - Void Shields cannot be put into equipment grid (which was added in previous version as an experiment). Reason: Factorio's energy shields pass impact damage type, and Titans decrease their equipment's shields just by walking, so Titans only use custom shields mechanic that considers resistances. WARNING: if you have already put Void Shields into a Titan's equipment grid, take it back before saving with this newer version.
