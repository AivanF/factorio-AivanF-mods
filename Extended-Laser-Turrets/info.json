  "description": "In case you are upset with other las turrets mods due to total imbalance, have a look at this one! ELT provides new grades and variants of laser turrets with smooth grow of distance, damage, health, energy consumption, and recipe cost. In addition, there are startup settings to adjust! Now it will perfectly fit you gameplay experience, no matter what modded enemies you have :)\n\nNow we have:\n- Laser Turret (vanilla MK1)\n- MK2 Damager: x2 damage\n- MK2 Ranger: x2 range\n- MK3 Damager: x4 damage x2 range\n- MK3 Ranger: x4 range x2 damage\n\nBoth variants indented to be used together to deal with swarms of small biter beasts as well as sole huge snapper bosses. SE supported (2 tier available earlier). Based on nice yet imbalanced DimmimoLongRangeLasers mod by Viidi."
