  "description": "Equip your vehicle with a Quantum Carburetor:\n1. Select destination position\n2. Put a bunch of fuel\n3. Accelerate to 88 km/h\n4. Teleport wherever you want! Even on other planets ;)\n\nCarburetors can be equipped into any vehicle: spidertron, tank, car (the mod adds equipment grid to car same as of tank), or added by other mods. However, it was created for my other mods:\n\n- WH40k Titans - powerful battle machines.\n- Ricks Space Cruiser - a fancy flying car.\n\nIs it imba? Well, maybe, but you deserve it! Although, the mod supposed to be not too cheaty: it calculates all the cargo weight and increased energy cost respectively."
