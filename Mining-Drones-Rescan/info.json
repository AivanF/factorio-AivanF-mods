    "description": "In case your mods configuration leads to weird problems requiring you to periodically call Mining Drones rescan manually â€“ this tiny mod will work for you calling resources rescan automatically. By default it activates each 5 seconds, see startup settings to adjust, also there is a runtime/map setting to enable printing so that you can verify that it works as intended."
