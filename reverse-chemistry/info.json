  "description": "Provides reverse recipes for compression:\n- Methane gas (if SE is installed) =>\n- Petroleum gas (aka propane gas) =>\n- Light oil =>\n- Heavy oil.\n\nMeant to be not cheaty, it's totally resource inefficient in a basic workflow, but can be greatly useful with mods that provide excess production of one resource. Configurable with startup settings: enable or disable any new recipe."
