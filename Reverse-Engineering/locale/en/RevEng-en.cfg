[entity-description]
af-reverse-lab-1=Performs reverse-engineering converting items into science packs. Has a chance of researching a technology related to input items.
af-reverse-lab-2=Performs reverse-engineering researches faster. Note that items of already researched recipes give 2 time less results!
af-reverse-lab-3=Performs reverse-engineering research converting items into science packs quickly and with 50% productivity bonus. But consumes much power!
