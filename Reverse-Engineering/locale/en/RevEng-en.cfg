page_1_text_1=Reverse-Engineering Lab performs reverse research converting items into science packs considering their worth. It is helpful when you have mods like WH40k Titans or ones that provide loot.\n\nTo perform reverse engineering, put source items into left chest, collect science packs from the top-right chest, and take out unprocessable stuff from the bottom-right chest.\n\nNote that scientific worth of items get dramatically decreased if you already can produce them yourself.\n
page_1_text_2=\nIn addition, you can use special window to see reverse-engineering cost of items:

[af-reverse-lab]
researched=Researched [technology=__1__] by reverse-engineering!
see-worth-title=Reverse Engineering evaluator
see-worth-info=Expected amount of science packs: __1__, pieces needed: __2__
a-science-pack=This is a science pack, it cannot be reverse-researched
useless=This item cannot be reversely researched

[entity-description]
af-reverse-lab-1=Performs reverse-engineering converting items into science packs. Has a chance of researching a technology related to input items.
af-reverse-lab-2=Performs reverse-engineering researches faster. Note that items of already researched recipes give 2 time less results!
af-reverse-lab-3=Performs reverse-engineering research converting items into science packs quickly and with 50% productivity bonus. But consumes much power!
